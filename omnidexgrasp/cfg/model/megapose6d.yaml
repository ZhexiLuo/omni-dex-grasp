# MegaPose6D pose estimation model config
# Reference: thirdparty/megapose6d/README.md Model Zoo recommendations

# Scene (with depth): multi-hypothesis + ICP depth refinement, highest accuracy

# Grasp (no depth): multi-hypothesis, no ICP
grasp_model: "megapose-1.0-RGB-multi-hypothesis"

# Inference parameters
n_refiner_iterations: 5    # refiner iterations
n_pose_hypotheses: 5       # number of pose hypotheses (multi-hypothesis K=5)

# GPU memory control (reduce to 32 on OOM)
